hint = """
            Notice how the nested loop behaves. The j loop iterates for N times and 
            the j loop itself is run N times.

            So, the total number of runs would be N + N + â€¦. N times

            Correct!
            The first set of nested loops is O(N^2) and the second loop is O(N). 

            This is O(max(N^2,N)) which is O(N^2).
